### The Problem 

A famous YouTuber, Keem, has a problem with his video streaming. He asks his friend, Scarce, for help. They both rack their brains, but are unsure of what to do. Keem wants to design a website to stream his videos without having to use YouTube and give them more ad traffic. 

### Your Mission 

Help Keem and Scarce design a website to feature some of your favorite youtube videos. Your website must contain: 

- at least 3 different YouTube videos in the body of the page
- a header, with the name of the website
- a footer, with some copyright information with the names of the members of your group

## Additional details

Please make your website as *pretty* as possible! To do this, please make use of divs and be creative with your CSS. You will have to look up how to put videos in your site and make the layout nice.
